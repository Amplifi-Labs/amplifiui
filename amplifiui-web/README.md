This library is still on initial phase of development. Feel free to use it, but be aware that structural changes are still possible. If you want to use it, please, lock the imported version on your package.json file.

Key concepts of this library:

- Based on Tailwind CSS (through twrnc);
- Based on the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid);
- Makes props for accessibility mandatory;
- Simplifies hard tasks like, adding animations, easier;
- Focus on reusability and flexibility;
- Heavily depends on SVGs;

If your project uses Amplifi UI, please, let us know! We would love :heart: to have this information!
